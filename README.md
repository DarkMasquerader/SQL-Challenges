# SQL Projects
This repository contains a subset of SQL challenges I have completed to demonstrate my proficiency in this database query language.

The documented challenges follow this structure:
- A brief overview of the challenge
- An explanation of the tables 
- Exemplar input-output
- My SQL solution with justification

Some challenges will also have an 'Extension' section where I have come up with an additional scenario based on the current challenge.

(**Note:** Particularly complex challenges are marked with an asterisk.)
